## Features

Makrukground is designed to fulfill all thaichess.org web and mobile apps needs, so it is pretty featureful.

- Well typed with TypeScript
- Fast. Uses a custom DOM diff algorithm to reduce DOM writes to the absolute minimum.
- Small footprint: 10K gzipped (31K unzipped). No dependencies.
- SVG drawing of circles, arrows, and custom user shapes on the board
- Arrows snap to valid moves. Freehand arrows can be drawn by dragging the mouse off the board and back while drawing an arrow.
- Entirely configurable and reconfigurable at any time
- Styling with CSS only: board and pieces can be changed by simply switching a class
- Fluid layout: board can be resized at any time
- Support for 3D pieces and boards
- Full mobile support (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- Move pieces by click
- Move pieces by drag & drop
  - Minimum distance before drag
  - Centralisation of the piece under the cursor
  - Piece ghost element
  - Drop off revert or trash
- Premove by click or drag
- Drag new pieces onto the board (editor, Crazyhouse)
- Animation of pieces: moving and fading away
- Display last move, check, move destinations, and premove destinations (hover effects possible)
- Import and export positions in FEN notation
- User callbacks
- No makruk logic inside
